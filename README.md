# TF Demo

Nicholas Maltbie, start 5-16-17

This is an attempt to create a graphical deisplay utilizing Jupyter Notebook to 
make an interactive demo to view a neural network and it's change while working 
with training data.

This will use 
 * Python 3.5
 * Tensor Flow
 * Anaconda
 * Jupyter Notebook
 * Scikit-learn
 * matplotlib
 * MNIST Handwritting data
 
# Quick Setup
Create a python 3.5 environment with Anaconda, launch the environment and run 
the following commands to setup the libraries. Once the commands complete, you 
can run the jupyter notebook via clicking the arrow.
```bash
pip install tensorflow
conda install jupyter
conda install matplotlib
conda install scikit-learn
python -m ipykernel install --name tensorflow
```
Remember to set the kernel to tensorflow when running the jupyter notebook 
(Doesnâ€™t really matter but helps avoid errors)
